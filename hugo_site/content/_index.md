  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Old-School Renaissance"
    subtitle="The game relies on the Game Master to adjudicate the outcome of the Players' actions using the rules as a toolbox. The Players must use their ingenuity and take advantage of their skills and gear to overcome the challenges they meet."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Streamlined and concise"
    subtitle="The rules strive to be as straightforward, intuitive, and brief as possible. No need to study a thick rulebook, memorise monster profiles taking whole pages, or reference the rulebook constantly."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Exhaustive rules"
    subtitle="The rulebook provides guidelines on how to handle common situations found in a fantasy adventure game, rather than just a set of basic mechanics left for the GM to completely figure out."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Deadly adventures"
    subtitle="Death is always behind the corner. Characters are normal people, not heroes, and every fight or challenge they face could be their last. As characters progress, they become more skilful but don't turn into one-man armies."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Simple yet deep combat"
    subtitle="Factions alternate activating their fighters, with a single roll for initiative. Attacks always hit unless performed under very challenging circumstances. Characters can react out of turn order, for example to defend against attacks."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Vile sorcery and corruption"
    subtitle="Sorcerers can spend mana to invoke powers safely, but can also push themselves at a risk of suffering corruption, which can result in damage and mutation. Sacred powers are safer but more limited."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Fast action resolution"
    subtitle="Just roll a d20 under an ability score. No modifiers, target numbers, or dice pools. Difficulty just comes in three steps: trivial (no roll, you just do it), challenging (roll to succeed), impossible (you just can’t do it)."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Skill-based character development"
    subtitle="Skills are keywords, a character either has them or they don't. They provide significant advantages, such as the ability to succeed in certain actions without rolling or to cast spells."
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Slot-based inventory"
    subtitle="Characters can carry a limited amount of gear, tracked with a slot-based inventory system requiring very little math and book-keeping."
